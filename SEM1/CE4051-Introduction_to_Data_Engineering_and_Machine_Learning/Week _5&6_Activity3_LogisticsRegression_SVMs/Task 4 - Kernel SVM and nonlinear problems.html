<p><strong>Weight 30/100</strong></p>
<p>Some problems are not linearly solvable, and SVMs offer a means of treating non-linear using kernels. The most used kernels are linear (i.e. no kernel, or what you implemented in the previous part) and Gaussian (or Radial Basis Function).&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are provided with a randomised dataset that is clearly not linearly separable, and obviously we could not separate the examples from the two classes very well using any of the linear methods - Perceptron, logistic regression or linear SVM.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Run an RBF (radial basis function, or Gaussian) kernel SVM model on the data</li>
<li>Plot the decision boundaries using the provided function (choose a soft gamma value of 0.1)</li>
<li>Change the gamma value to 100. What happens? What is the problem with this result? Describe what is happening based on the resources given in the activity.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Then:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat for the multi-class Iris data, to provide a multi-class, nonlinear solution&nbsp;</li>
</ul></body></html>
