<p>Do something different. This can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate other types of feature selection, dimensionality reduction</li>
<li>Provide some code that implements this for the current task or provide 3 or 4 paragraphs discussing the new technique (Guideline size: 500 words (this is only a rough guide))</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are just examples. Feel free to investigate other things related to data engineering in the context of machine learning. Why is it important?</p></body></html>
